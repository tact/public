# Tact FAQ

**Why does Tact not remember my window size, position, and sidebar size on macOS?**

This relies on macOS state restoration. This is controlled by the `Close windows when quitting an app` preference in Settings, General. Make sure that the checkbox is turned off: macOS window should then function as expected in terms of remembering size, position, and sidebar size.
